The Storage Compartment module will now try to eject disallowed items into your inventory if there's space before dropping them on the ground as a failsafe. If it does have to drop items, it will now ping the dropped item in the world and log its location in the game logs.

Thanks pr0theus for brining up that the item ejecting behavior was easy to miss, hopefully this makes it clearer!
